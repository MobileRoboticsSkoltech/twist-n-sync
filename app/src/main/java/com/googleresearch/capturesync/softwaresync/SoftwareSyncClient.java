/**
 * Client which registers and synchronizes clocks with SoftwareSyncLeader. This allows it to receive
 * messages and timestamps at which to simultaneously process commands such as capturing a photo at
 * the same time as the leader device.
 *
 * <p>The client can be in one of internal three states: Waiting for leader, registered but not
 * synced, and synced.
 *
 * <p>On instantiation, the client attempts to register with the leader, and is waiting for the
 * leader to respond.
 *
 * <p>Then, once it is registered but not yet synced, it requests SNTP synchronization with the
 * leader. Here it listens for offsetNs update rpc messages and sets it's offsetNs to that, thereby
 * synchronizing it's clock with leader to the precision requested.
 *
 * <p>Finally, once the leader responds with an time correction offsetNs, it enters the synced
 * state.
 *
 * <p>>User should handle thrown IOExceptions for networking. The most common cause for a thrown
 * exception is when the user closes the client down, but there is still a socket receive or a
 * periodic heartbeat send still in progress.
